Hello everybody,\
The next week's lesson is our last lesson. It's your stage.\'a0\
Every team should make a presentation about your system. You can discuss who the main speaker is.\
Every team could have 30 minutes to demo your system. There are no special requirements about your slides.\
Just imagine you are holding a product launch. Like Apple inc. releases new version iOS. There are not only the demonstration of the new system, but also the slides. You can refer to it, or to other product launchs.\
The purpose of the presentation is to introduce your system to us.\
The order could be the same as that in the excel of taskallocation.\'a0\
Besides, I modified the deadline of the last assignment to August 6, 2020. Because, when you are presenting, maybe I will give you some suggestions. Then, after the last lesson, you can have 2 days to modify your works.\
Hope all of you work well.}
